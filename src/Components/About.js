                    courseoverflow emerged as an online education company that helps students to overcome their pain areas in academics by providing the exact resources they need. In courseoverflow, we focus on providing one to one live sessions, thus adding value to the academic curriculum by supplementing it. For those who aspire to excel, the adaptive process leads them to challenge themselves. The Teachers are from reputed institutions, carefully chosen to be highly adaptive to deliver online live classes.

                    courseoverflow provides personalised online tuition, mentoring and coaching to students. The program is highly flexible which means the number of sessions can be scaled up or down as per need.

                    Once enrolled, the students receive a series of custom scheduled sessions from an approved private one to one Teacher. Students need to have a good internet connection. Students can access our interactive whiteboard to attend the sessions on their PC at the convenience of their own homes.

                    Sessions are generally one on one, group sessions will be offered from time to time as needed. Students are encouraged to communicate with their teacher about any questions or doubts using the courseoverflow account. We continuously assess the student and adapt our e-tutoring to meet their needs.

                    We believe that every child has a right to reach their full potential. We also understand that each child is different. So we engage with each student with an adaptive approach. This involves the collection of student's exercises, their school plan, schedule of tests. The teacher gets to know the student's strengths and weaknesses and builds up a strategy to reach their goals. This kind of approach will take a few months to take effect as the teacher and student gets to know each other better. We encourage student and parent participation to share more academic information and ambitions or goals pertaining to the student.

                    We are in the process of continuously changing with the needs of modern education methodology to prepare students for the jobs of the future. This includes the use of technology to personalise education to each student. We aim to help each student to attain the much needed life skill, of a life long learner.

                    In order to unleash the childâ€™s full potential, we join hands with parents to nurture their academic dreams, helping them to pursue their academic interests with our resources.
